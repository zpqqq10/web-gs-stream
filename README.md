# SIMPLE WEB PLAYER

A simple web player for playing 4dgs videos, developed for *4D Gaussian Videos with Motion Layering*. An accompanying backend is provided in `./backend`.

The player is based on **WebGL** and works with multithreading for downloading, decoding, and rendering. Binary files under `./assets` are morton atlases generated by compression scripts.

Special thanks to [Scthe](https://github.com/Scthe/gaussian-splatting-webgpu/) and [splat](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat/tree/main/).
