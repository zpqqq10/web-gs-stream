# SIMPLE WEB PLAYER

A simple web player for playing 4dgs videos, developed for *4D Gaussian Videos with Motion Layering*. An accompanying backend is provided in `./backend`.

The player is based on **WebGL** and works with multithreading for downloading, decoding, and rendering. Binary files under `./assets` are morton atlases generated by compression scripts. The player supports rendering at ~60 FPS based on WebGL and cpu sorting, or at ~45 FPS based on WebGPU sorting.
